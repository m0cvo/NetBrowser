NetBrowser

Decided To create a new web browser for myself but noted that the old Web Browser feature had been deprecated in VS 2022 and .NET 6.
Therefore, I did some investigations and found some information on WebView2 at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/get-started/winforms.
A list of contributors appears here and, although I haven't directly copied their work to a T, I have incorporated some of it. 

This solution does require that you add Microsoft.Web.WebView2 from NuGet (<TOOLS> <Manage NuGet> Microsoft.Web.WebView2).

The whole app is developed using Windows Forms in .NET 6 on Visual Studio 2022 and appears to work satisfactorily. 

If you wish to use my work in any demonstration or project of your own please feel free to do so but please do credit me in your write up as a contributor.  
Please also note that it may not yet be complete and there may still be bugs to iron out..
